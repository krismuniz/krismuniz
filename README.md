:wave: ¡Wepa!

I'm Kristian, a software developer, designer, and open source enthusiast from [Puerto Rico](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico "Link to Puerto Rico's Wikipedia Page") – currently based in San José, California. I love writing JavaScript, building products, and open-sourcing tools and libraries.

### Work

I'm currently CTO & Co-Founder of [Claimbot](https://claimbotcx.com), a customer experience automation platform for businesses in the insurance and automotive industries.

### Hobbies

About half of my free time is split between maintaining and ([casually](https://krismuniz.com/posts/casual-open-source)) contributing to open source projects here on [GitHub](https://github.com/krismuniz), making music, and [writing](https://krismuniz.com/posts) (occasionally).
